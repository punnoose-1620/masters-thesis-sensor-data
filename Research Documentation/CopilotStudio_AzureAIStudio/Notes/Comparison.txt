When to use each
✅ Use Microsoft Copilot if:

You only want an AI assistant inside Word/Teams/Outlook

You don’t want to build or deploy your own chatbot

You want ready-made features (summarize meetings, write emails, etc.)

Copilot is mainly for personal productivity, not for creating custom stakeholder chatbots.

✅ Use Azure AI + Azure OpenAI if:

You want a chatbot for your company/stakeholders

You want it to answer based on your organization’s documents

You want full control (UI, access, logging, security)

You want to deploy it as a website/app/Teams bot
